## Classifying Clapper Rails and King Rails Based on their Kek Calls

This project will analyze acoustic markers derived from audio recordings of Clapper Rails and King Rails in an attempt to classify the species.  During this analysis we will review the following questions:
 - Can we reproduce the basic findings regarding optimal machine learning models for this classification?
 - Are there improvements that can be made in the outcomes?
